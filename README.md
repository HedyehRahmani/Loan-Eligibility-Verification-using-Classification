# Loan Eligibility Prediction with Classification Algorithms

This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate the implementation of classification algorithms using Python's `scikit-learn` library. The project is designed to provide a comprehensive guide to building, training, and evaluating classification models, which are essential tools for predictive analysis in financial services, particularly in loan approval processes.

## Introduction

Classification is a powerful supervised learning technique that allows us to categorize data points into predefined classes. In this project, we focus on predicting loan eligibility for applicants based on their demographic and financial information.

## Project Scope

Loans are a critical component of banking operations, but not all loans are repaid. To minimize the risk of default, banks need to carefully assess loan applications. This project involves developing a classification model to predict whether a loan should be approved or denied based on historical data of loan applicants.

### Your Role

In this project, you assume the role of a data scientist working for a bank. You are provided with a dataset containing details of loan applicants, and your task is to develop a model that predicts whether an applicant should be granted a loan. This prediction will help the bank make informed decisions and reduce the risk of loan defaults.

### Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a classification model that achieves an accuracy of at least 76% in predicting loan eligibility. The model will be evaluated based on its ability to correctly classify applicants as eligible or ineligible for a loan.

### Specifics

- **Machine Learning Task:** Classification model
- **Target Variable:** Loan_Status
- **Input Variables:** Various demographic and financial attributes of the applicants
- **Success Criteria:** Model accuracy of 76% and above

This repository serves as an educational resource for those looking to understand the fundamentals of classification modeling and its application in financial services.

## Installation

To set up the environment for this project, install the required Python packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HedyehRahmani/Loan-Eligibility-Verification-using-Classification.git
   ```

2. Run the Python script to load the data, train the model, and evaluate the results:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Modeling Process

### Data Preparation

The dataset is loaded, and basic preprocessing steps are performed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and exploring the data through visualizations.

### Classification Model

The project demonstrates how to:

- Set up and train a classification model using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results

After training the model, the script provides an analysis of the results, including the model's accuracy and insights into the factors that most influence loan approval decisions.
